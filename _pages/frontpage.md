## Welcome to ReviewQ

Welcome to ReviewQ, my private and personal site designed to integrate all of my notes, bookmarks, and other content into one cohesive platform. This site will always remain a personal project and is not intended to be offered as a service.

### Purpose of ReviewQ

The inspiration behind ReviewQ comes from Dave Winer's blog, which has been a significant influence due to his ongoing work on both hardware and software for nearly 28 years. His blog stands as a historical record of his continuous effort, shared daily through his email links and titles.

### Integration and Automation

The core idea of ReviewQ is to create a centralized place where I can input information and seamlessly route it to various other platforms. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Single Input Point**: Post a message here and tag it to send to multiple platforms such as Twitter or Keybase. For instance, tagging a post appropriately can automatically send it to Twitter or update a relevant group on Keybase.
- **Blog and Wiki Updates**: Tags can also direct content to my blog or update a wiki that stores information. Instead of posting every save, updates might be summarized weekly or monthly to avoid overwhelming notifications.
- **Visibility of Work**: The goal is to make my work visible, showcasing my interests, current activities, and areas of expertise. This could also include links to my resume.

### Contribution and Review Mechanism

While ReviewQ is primarily for personal use, I acknowledge that others might find a similar system useful. Making this project visible and open to contributions is an additional objective.

- **Review Queue**: All postings initially go to a queue for review. Upon approval, they can be sent to an editing stack or directly posted, clearly indicating the target destinations.
- **Kanban Board System**: The review queue functions like a Kanban board. Posts move through various slots, from initial review to final posting. Once successfully posted, they move to the 'done' slot.

### Future Vision

The first goal is to get the review queue operational, allowing posts to flow through the system efficiently. The long-term vision is to have a robust, automated, and user-friendly system that not only serves my needs but also stands as a model for others interested in similar projects.

Thank you for visiting ReviewQ. This platform is a testament to my dedication to streamlined content management and sharing, reflecting both my professional and personal endeavors.
