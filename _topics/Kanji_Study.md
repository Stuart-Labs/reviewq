## Study the most used Kanji



One of my goals is to study just enough. One strategy is focus on the words that people use. 

	1.	N5 Level (approximately 100-200 kanji):
	•	This level covers basic kanji and allows for understanding simple sentences and phrases commonly used in daily life.
	•	Coverage: Approximately 10-20% of commonly used written Japanese.
	2.	N4 Level (approximately 300-500 kanji):
	•	At this level, you can read simple sentences and short passages written in basic kanji, such as those found in beginner textbooks and simple articles.
	•	Coverage: Around 20-40% of commonly used written Japanese.
	3.	N3 Level (approximately 600-800 kanji):
	•	With N3, you can understand more complex sentences and intermediate-level texts. This includes some newspaper articles, manga, and everyday materials.
	•	Coverage: Approximately 40-60% of commonly used written Japanese.
	4.	N2 Level (approximately 1,000-1,300 kanji):
	•	N2 kanji knowledge allows for reading a wide range of texts, including newspapers, literature, and more sophisticated materials.
	•	Coverage: Around 60-80% of commonly used written Japanese.
	5.	N1 Level (approximately 2,000-2,500 kanji):
	•	This level includes the Jōyō Kanji (2,136 kanji) and a few more. It enables you to read most texts, including newspapers, academic papers, and modern literature.
	•	Coverage: Around 90-95% of commonly used written Japanese.
	6.	Beyond N1 Level (3,000 kanji and above):
	•	Knowing more than 3,000 kanji allows for understanding specialized texts, historical documents, and classical literature.
	•	Coverage: Approximately 98-99% of commonly used written Japanese.
	7.	Advanced Level (5,000 kanji and above):
	•	Mastery of over 5,000 kanji enables you to read virtually any written material, including highly specialized and technical texts.
	•	Coverage: 99.9% and above of commonly used written Japanese.

[This Google Sheet][three_thosand_kanji] has 3000 Kanji, in order of most used, with several examples words that use that Kanji. So by going down from the start and learning the words that you don’t know, my assumption is that you are increasing the number of useful kanji. The reverse is also true, if you go up from the bottom, you are just encountering useless kanji that most
