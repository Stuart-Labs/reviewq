I had a crazy dream about a car journey in an antique car with a small kid happily riding on the hood at one point. We ended up talking to a doctor in the hospital. It might have been a mortality related dream as the doctor said that one of us should be in the hospital but whoever it was that was dying just wanted to see some place before it was too late.

I only mention it because it has been a while since I had such a cinematic dream that I woke up in the middle of.

Pretty much logical dream ideas are garbage in the morning. Creative ideas are probably more worth keeping.
