# Words

The etymology of words that I find interesting:

### World <a id="world">#</a>
“[world](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/world#Middle_English)” (were-eld) man-age The age of men. “[Were](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/wer)” is connected to the “were” in “[werewolf](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/werewolf#English)” and to “[virile](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/virile) which can be traced back to Sanskrit.
