# Markdown Tools

## mdcat

`mdcat` is a command-line utility designed to render Markdown files directly in the terminal, providing a more visually appealing way to view Markdown content without needing a web browser or Markdown-specific editor.

#### Key Features of `mdcat`:

1. **Terminal Rendering**:
   - `mdcat` displays Markdown content with basic formatting in your terminal, including headers, lists, code blocks, tables, and emphasis (bold, italics).
   - It supports ANSI colors to enhance the readability of the content, differentiating various Markdown elements visually.

2. **Link Handling**:
   - It can detect and handle links, displaying them in a way that makes them usable directly from the terminal.
   - If your terminal supports it, `mdcat` can make links clickable.

3. **Image Display**:
   - On supported terminals, `mdcat` can display images embedded in Markdown files directly in the terminal window. This feature is terminal-dependent and requires a terminal that supports inline images (such as iTerm2 on macOS).

4. **Compatibility**:
   - `mdcat` works on various Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. It leverages the terminal's capabilities to render Markdown in a way that mimics what you might expect from a basic Markdown viewer in a graphical environment.

5. **Navigation**:
   - You can use typical terminal navigation commands (like `less`) to scroll through the document, making it practical for viewing longer Markdown files.

#### Usage

To use `mdcat`, you generally just pass the path to a Markdown file as an argument. Here’s an example:

```bash
mdcat README.md
```

This command will render the contents of `README.md` directly in your terminal.

#### Installation

`mdcat` can be installed through package managers or built from source. On macOS, for instance, you might install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install mdcat
```

On Linux, installation might involve using a package manager like `apt` (if a package is available) or building from the source available on GitHub.

#### Practical Use Cases

- **Quick Markdown Viewing**: When working in a terminal-centric environment, `mdcat` allows you to quickly preview Markdown files without switching to a different application.
- **Documentation**: Developers often use Markdown for project documentation (`README.md` files, for example). `mdcat` makes it easy to view these directly in the terminal.
- **Editing Workflow**: When working with Markdown documents in a terminal-based editor like `vim` or `nano`, `mdcat` allows you to preview changes instantly.

Overall, `mdcat` is a handy tool for those who frequently work in the terminal 
and prefer to keep their workflows streamlined and efficient.

## grip

`grip` (short for "GitHub Readme Instant Preview") is a command-line tool designed to render Markdown files exactly as they would appear on GitHub. This is particularly useful for developers who want to preview their README files or other Markdown documents in a GitHub-style rendering before pushing them to a repository.

#### Key Features of `grip`:

1. **GitHub-Style Rendering**:
   - `grip` uses the same Markdown engine as GitHub, ensuring that what you see locally is an accurate preview of how the content will appear on GitHub. This includes GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM) features such as tables, task lists, and fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting.

2. **Local Server**:
   - When you run `grip`, it starts a local web server and opens your default web browser to display the rendered Markdown file. This allows you to interact with the preview as if you were viewing the document directly on GitHub.

3. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - `grip` can watch your Markdown files for changes, automatically updating the preview in your browser as you edit the file. This is particularly useful for real-time editing and previewing.

4. **Simple Command-Line Interface**:
   - `grip` is easy to use from the command line. You just point it to a Markdown file, and it handles the rest.

5. **No GitHub Authentication Needed**:
   - For most use cases, `grip` does not require authentication with GitHub. However, if you're previewing a private repository, you can provide your GitHub credentials to `grip` so it can access the private content.

6. **Customizable**:
   - `grip` allows some customization, such as choosing a different port for the local server or controlling whether the server automatically opens a browser.

#### Usage

To use `grip`, you simply pass the path to a Markdown file as an argument. Here’s a basic example:

```bash
grip README.md
```

This command starts a local server (typically at `http://localhost:6419`) and opens your default browser to display the rendered `README.md` file.

#### Example Workflow

1. **Install `grip`**:
   - You can install `grip` using `pip`, the Python package manager:
     ```bash
     pip install grip
     ```

2. **Preview a Markdown File**:
   - Navigate to your project directory and run:
     ```bash
     grip
     ```
   - By default, `grip` will look for a `README.md` file in the current directory and render it. You can specify a different file if needed.

3. **Automatic Updates**:
   - While `grip` is running, any changes you make to the Markdown file will automatically be reflected in the browser.

#### Practical Use Cases

- **README Previews**: Before pushing changes to GitHub, you can use `grip` to ensure your README or other Markdown documentation looks as intended.
- **Documentation Development**: When writing extensive documentation in Markdown, `grip` allows for continuous previewing, ensuring that your content adheres to GitHub’s rendering style.
- **Collaborative Reviews**: You can share the local server URL with others on your local network for collaborative review of Markdown files.

Overall, `grip` is a useful tool for anyone who frequently works with Markdown files intended for GitHub, providing a straightforward way to ensure that content is formatted and displayed correctly.
