## Thoughts

* DNS is the week point of the Internet. I can make a site on Github but I can't keep the domain it is hosted on for ever. Like a graveyard where the stones wear out. 
	
	Rich people should put more money into stone tablets. Especially those rocks which have survived the longest. Or even pyramids. I wonder if billionaires could afford to make a new pyramid.

# July 2024 - Review Queue

## Bloom Filters

[A Tiny, Static, Full-Text Search Engine using Rust and WebAssembly | Matthias Endler][search_using_bloom_filters] 
* TODO: Try this!
> The idea was simple: Let's run all my blog articles through a generator that creates a tiny, self-contained search index using this magical data structure called a ✨Bloom Filter ✨.

## Semantic Grep

[Semantic Grep][semantic_grep]

> sgrep is a command-line tool that performs semantic searches on text input using word embeddings. It's designed to find semantically similar matches to the query, going beyond simple string matching. The experience is designed to be similar to grep.


## ReviewQ Ideas
* [IDEA] - Find all the todos and and all the ideas and make a generated page to find them.
* [IDEA] - Get all the changes that were made during the month and get ChatGTP API to summarise them into a monthly summary page. Must only be text changes not settings changes.
